      question: "How is ThriveStack different from MixPanel, Amplitude, or June?",
      answer: "Most analytics tools track in-app events and feature usage, but they fail to connect the impact across marketing, onboarding, and monetization. ThriveStack helps you:\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Understand why users convert from free to paid\n‚úîÔ∏è Track the entire customer journey from acquisition to retention\n‚úîÔ∏è Know exactly why users upgrade and replicate success\n‚úîÔ∏è Identify churn risks before they happen and take action\n‚úîÔ∏è Measure viral growth & referrals to unlock organic expansion"

      question: "Why does your billing use Monthly Active Users (MAUs) as opposed to Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs) by your competition?",
      answer: "Our Competition is passing on the Storage and Compute costs by tracking MTUs. MAUs is the true measure of engagement and growth. We prefer to tilt towards helping your Product grow rather than nickel-and-dime you.\n\na. MTUs include all tracked users, even inactive ones.\nb. MAUs only count users who actively interact with the product.\nc. Billing by MTUs is nickel-and-diming you. MAUs are used for measuring real product adoption and retention.\n\ne.g. If 50,000 users have been tracked (but only 5,000 were active), the MTU is 50,000, MAUs is 5,000"
